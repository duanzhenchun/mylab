<p>She woke with a gasp, not knowing who she was, or where.</p><p>fruit, for smiling and joking, for working hard and doing as she was told.</p><p></p><p>“Mercy, Mercy, Mercy,” she sang as she descended the wooden stair to the street. The <span title="bannister.n.02:
a railing at the side of a staircase or balcony to prevent people from falling" >handrail</span> was <span title="splintery.s.01:
subject to breaking into sharp slender pieces" >splintery</span>, the steps steep, and there were five flights, but that was why she’d <span title="get.v.01:
come into the possession of something concrete or abstract" >gotten</span> the room so cheap. That, and Mercy’s smile. She might be bald and skinny, but Mercy had a pretty smile, and a certain grace. Even Izembaro agreed that she was graceful. She was not far from the Gate as the crows flies, but for girls with feet instead of wings the way was longer. Braavos was a crooked city. The streets were crooked, the alleys were <span title="crooked.a.01:
having or marked by bends or angles; not straight or aligned" >crookeder</span>, and the canals were crookedest of all. Most days she preferred to go the long way, down the Ragman’s Road along the Outer <span title="seaport.n.01:
a sheltered port where ships can take on or discharge cargo" >Harbor</span>, where she had the sea before her and the sky above, and a clear view across the Great <span title="lagoon.n.01:
a body of water cut off from a larger body by a reef of sand or coral" >Lagoon</span> to the Arsenal and the piney slopes of Sellagoro’s Shield. Sailors would hail her as she passed the docks, calling down from the decks of <span title="loiter.v.01:
be about" >tarry</span> Ibbenese <span title="whaler.n.01:
a seaman who works on a ship that hunts whales" >whalers</span> and big-bellied Westerosi <span title="cog.n.01:
a subordinate who performs an important but routine function" >cogs</span>. Mercy could not always understand their words, but she knew what they were saying. Sometimes she would smile back and tell them they could find her at the Gate if they had the coin.</p><p></p><p>The long way also took her across the Bridge of Eyes with its carved stone faces. From the top of its span, she could look through the arches and see all the city: the green copper domes of the Hall of Truth, the masts rising like a forest from the Purple <span title="seaport.n.01:
a sheltered port where ships can take on or discharge cargo" >Harbor</span>, the tall towers of the mighty, the golden <span title="thunderbolt.n.01:
a discharge of lightning accompanied by thunder" >thunderbolt</span> turning on its spire <span title="atop.r.01:
on, to, or at the top" >atop</span> the Sealord’s Palace… even the <span title="colossus.n.02:
a person of exceptional importance and reputation" >Titan</span>’s bronze shoulders, off across the dark green waters. But that was only when the sun was shining down on Braavos. If the fog was thick there was nothing to see but grey, so today Mercy chose the shorter route to save some wear on her poor cracked boots.</p><p></p><p>The mists seemed to part before her and close up again as she passed. The <span title="cobble.n.01:
rectangular paving stone with curved top; once used to make roads" >cobblestones</span> were wet and <span title="slickness.n.03:
a slippery smoothness" >slick</span> under her feet. She heard a cat <span title="bellow.n.01:
a very loud utterance (like the sound of an animal)" >yowl</span> <span title="plaintively.r.01:
in a plaintive manner" >plaintively</span>. Braavos was a good city for cats, and they <span title="roll.v.12:
move about aimlessly or without any destination, often in search of food or employment" >roamed</span> everywhere, especially at night. In the fog all cats are grey, Mercy thought. In the fog all men are killers.</p><p></p><p>She had never seen a thicker fog than this one. On the larger canals, the <span title="boatman.n.01:
someone who drives or rides in a boat" >watermen</span> would be running their serpent boats into one another, unable to make out any more than dim lights from the buildings to either side of them.</p><p></p><p>Mercy passed an old man with a lantern walking the other way, and envied him his light. The street was so gloomy she could scarcely see where she was stepping. In the <span title="humble.s.01:
low or inferior in station or quality" >humbler</span> parts of the city, the houses, shops, and warehouses crowded together, leaning on each other like drunken lovers, their upper stories so close that you could step from one balcony to the next. The streets below became dark tunnels where every <span title="footfall.n.01:
the sound of a step of someone walking" >footfall</span> echoed. The small canals were even more hazardous, since many of the houses that lined them had privies <span title="protrusion.n.02:
the act of projecting out from something" >jutting</span> out over the water. Izembaro loved to give the Sealord’s speech from The Merchant’s Melancholy Daughter, about how “here the last <span title="colossus.n.02:
a person of exceptional importance and reputation" >Titan</span> yet stands, <span title="astride.r.01:
with one leg on each side" >astride</span> the stony shoulders of his brothers,” but Mercy preferred the scene where the fat merchant <span title="denounce.v.04:
give away information about somebody" >shat</span> on the Sealord’s head as he passed underneath in his gold-and-purple barge. Only in Braavos could something like that happen, it was said, and only in Braavos would Sealord and sailor alike <span title="howl.n.01:
a long loud emotional utterance" >howl</span> with laughter to see it.</p><p></p><p>The Gate stood close by the edge of Drowned Town, between the Outer <span title="seaport.n.01:
a sheltered port where ships can take on or discharge cargo" >Harbor</span> and the Purple <span title="seaport.n.01:
a sheltered port where ships can take on or discharge cargo" >Harbor</span>. An old warehouse had burnt there and the ground was sinking a little more each year, so the land came cheap. <span title="atop.r.01:
on, to, or at the top" >Atop</span> the flooded stone foundation of the warehouse, Izembaro raised his <span title="cavernous.s.01:
being or suggesting a cavern" >cavernous</span> playhall. The Dome and the Blue Lantern might enjoy more fashionable environs, he told his <span title="mime.n.01:
an actor who communicates entirely by gesture and facial expression" >mummers</span>, but here between the <span title="seaport.n.01:
a sheltered port where ships can take on or discharge cargo" >harbors</span> they would never lack for sailors and whores to fill their pit. The Ship was close by, still pulling handsome crowds to the quay where she had been moored for twenty years, he said, and the Gate would flourish too.</p><p></p><p>Time had proved him right. The Gate’s stage had developed a tilt as the building settled, their costumes were prone to <span title="mildew.n.01:
the process of becoming mildewed" >mildew</span>, and water snakes nested in the flooded cellar, but none of that troubled the <span title="mime.n.01:
an actor who communicates entirely by gesture and facial expression" >mummers</span> so long as the house was full.</p><p></p><p>The last bridge was made of rope and raw planks, and seemed to dissolve into nothingness, but that was only the fog. Mercy <span title="scurry.v.01:
to move about or proceed hurriedly" >scampered</span> across, her heels ringing on the wood. The fog opened before her like a <span title="tattered.s.01:
worn to shreds; or wearing torn or ragged clothing" >tattered</span> grey curtain to reveal the <span title="playhouse.n.01:
plaything consisting of a small model of a house that children can play inside of" >playhouse</span>. <span title="pantry.n.01:
a small storeroom for storing foods or wines" >Buttery</span> yellow light spilled from the doors, and Mercy could hear voices from within. Beside the entrance, Big Brusco had painted over the title of the last show, and written The Bloody Hand in its place in huge red letters. He was painting a bloody hand beneath the words, for those who could not read. Mercy stopped to have a look. “That’s a nice hand,” she told him.</p><p></p><p>“Thumb’s crooked.” Brusco <span title="dab.v.01:
apply (usually a liquid) to a surface" >dabbed</span> at it with his brush. “King o’ the <span title="mime.n.01:
an actor who communicates entirely by gesture and facial expression" >Mummers</span> been asking after you.”</p><p></p><p>“It was so dark I slept and slept.” When Izembaro had first <span title="dub.v.01:
give a nickname to" >dubbed</span> himself the King of the <span title="mime.n.01:
an actor who communicates entirely by gesture and facial expression" >Mummers</span>, the company had taken a wicked pleasure in it, <span title="tasting.n.03:
taking a small amount into the mouth to test its quality" >savoring</span> the outrage of their rivals from the Dome and the Blue Lantern. Of late, though, Izembaro had begun to take his title too seriously. “He will only play kings now,” Marro said, rolling his eyes, “and if the play has no king in it, he would sooner not stage it at all.”</p><p></p><p>The Bloody Hand offered two kings, the fat one and the boy. Izembaro would play the fat one. It was not a large part, but he had a fine speech as he lay dying, and a splendid fight with a demonic boar before that. Phario Forel had written it, and he had the <span title="bloody.a.01:
having or covered with or accompanied by blood" >bloodiest</span> <span title="quill.n.01:
pen made from a bird's feather" >quill</span> of all of Braavos.</p><p></p><p>Mercy found the company assembled behind the stage, and slipped in between Daena and the <span title="center.n.10:
(football) the person who plays center on the line of scrimmage and snaps the ball to the quarterback" >Snapper</span> at the back, hoping her late arrival would go unnoticed. Izembaro was telling everyone that he expected the Gate to be packed to the <span title="rafter.n.01:
one of several parallel sloping beams that support a roof" >rafters</span> this evening, despite the fog. “The King of Westeros is sending his envoy to do homage to the King of the <span title="mime.n.01:
an actor who communicates entirely by gesture and facial expression" >Mummers</span> tonight,” he told his <span title="company.n.04:
organization of performers and associated personnel (especially theatrical)" >troupe</span>. “We will not disappoint our fellow monarch.”</p><p></p><p>“We?” said the <span title="center.n.10:
(football) the person who plays center on the line of scrimmage and snaps the ball to the quarterback" >Snapper</span>, who did all the costumes for the <span title="mime.n.01:
an actor who communicates entirely by gesture and facial expression" >mummers</span>. “Is there more than one of him, now?”</p><p></p><p>“He’s fat enough to count for two,” whispered Bobono. Every <span title="mime.n.01:
an actor who communicates entirely by gesture and facial expression" >mummer</span>’s <span title="company.n.04:
organization of performers and associated personnel (especially theatrical)" >troupe</span> had to have a dwarf. He was theirs. When he saw Mercy, he gave her a <span title="sneer.n.01:
a facial expression of contempt or scorn; the upper lip curls" >leer</span>. “Oho,” he said, “there she is. Is the little girl all ready for her rape?” He smacked his lips.</p><p></p><p>The <span title="center.n.10:
(football) the person who plays center on the line of scrimmage and snaps the ball to the quarterback" >Snapper</span> smacked him in the head. “Be quiet.”</p><p></p><p>The King of the <span title="mime.n.01:
an actor who communicates entirely by gesture and facial expression" >Mummers</span> ignored the brief commotion. He was still talking, telling the <span title="mime.n.01:
an actor who communicates entirely by gesture and facial expression" >mummers</span> how magnificent they must be. Besides the Westerosi envoy, there would be keyholders in the crowd this evening, and famous <span title="concubine.n.01:
a woman who cohabits with an important man" >courtesans</span> as well. He did not intend for them to leave with a poor opinion of the Gate. “It shall go ill for any man who fails me,” he promised, a threat he borrowed from the speech Prince Garin gives on the eve of battle in <span title="wrathful.s.01:
vehemently incensed and condemnatory" >Wroth</span> of the Dragonlords, Phario Forel’s first play.</p><p></p><p>By the time Izembaro finally finished speaking, less than an hour remained before the show, and the <span title="mime.n.01:
an actor who communicates entirely by gesture and facial expression" >mummers</span> were all frantic and <span title="antsy.s.01:
nervous and unable to relax" >fretful</span> by turns. The Gate rang to the sound of Mercy’s name.</p><p></p><p>“Mercy,” her friend Daena <span title="beg.v.01:
call upon in supplication; entreat" >implored</span>, “Lady <span title="stork.n.01:
large mostly Old World wading birds typically having white-and-black plumage" >Stork</span> has stepped on the hem of her gown again. Come help me sew it up.”</p><p></p><p>“Mercy,” the Stranger called, “bring the bloody paste, my horn is coming loose.”</p><p></p><p>“Mercy,” boomed Izembaro the Great himself, “what have you done with my crown, girl? I cannot make my entrance without my crown. How shall they know that I’m a king?”</p><p></p><p>“Mercy,” <span title="whine.v.03:
make a high-pitched, screeching noise" >squeaked</span> the dwarf Bobono, “Mercy, something’s amiss with my laces, my cock keeps <span title="flop.v.01:
fall loosely" >flopping</span> out.”</p><p></p><p>She fetched the sticky paste and <span title="fasten.v.01:
cause to be firmly attached" >fastened</span> the Stranger’s left horn back onto his forehead. She found Izembaro’s crown in the privy where he always left it and helped him pin it to his wig, and then ran for needle and thread so the <span title="center.n.10:
(football) the person who plays center on the line of scrimmage and snaps the ball to the quarterback" >Snapper</span> could sew the lace hem back onto the cloth-of-gold gown that the queen would wear in the wedding scene.</p><p></p><p>And Bobono’s cock was indeed <span title="flop.v.01:
fall loosely" >flopping</span> out. It was made to <span title="floating-point_operation.n.01:
an arithmetic operation performed on floating-point numbers" >flop</span> out, for the rape. What a hideous thing, Mercy thought as she knelt before the dwarf to fix him. The cock was a foot long and as thick as her arm, big enough to be seen from the highest balcony. The <span title="dyer.n.01:
someone whose job is to dye cloth" >dyer</span> had done a poor job with the leather, though; the thing was a <span title="mottle.v.01:
mark with spots or blotches of different color or shades of color as if stained" >mottled</span> pink and white, with a <span title="bulblike.s.01:
shaped like a bulb" >bulbous</span> head the <span title="color.n.01:
a visual attribute of things that results from the light they emit or transmit or reflect" >color</span> of a plum. Mercy pushed it back into Bobono’s <span title="breeches.n.01:
trousers ending above the knee" >breeches</span> and laced him back up. “Mercy,” he sang as she tied him tight, “Mercy, Mercy, come to my room tonight and make a man of me.”</p><p></p><p>“I’ll make a <span title="eunuch.n.01:
a man who has been castrated and is incapable of reproduction" >eunuch</span> of you if you keep <span title="untie.v.01:
undo the ties of" >unlacing</span> yourself just so I’ll fiddle with your <span title="fork.n.03:
the region of the angle formed by the junction of two branches" >crotch</span>.”</p><p></p><p>“We were meant to be together, Mercy,” Bobono insisted. “Look, we’re just the same height.”</p><p></p><p>“Only when I’m on my knees. Do you remember your first line?” It had only been a fortnight since the dwarf had <span title="stagger.v.01:
walk as if unable to control one's movements" >lurched</span> onto stage in his cups and opened The Anguish of the Archon with the grumpkin’s speech from The Merchant’s <span title="lustful.s.03:
vigorously passionate" >Lusty</span> Lady. Izembaro would skin him alive if he made such a <span title="blunder.n.01:
an embarrassing mistake" >blunder</span> again, and never mind how hard it was to find a good dwarf.</p><p></p><p>“What are we playing, Mercy?” Bobono asked innocently.</p><p></p><p>He is teasing me, Mercy thought. He’s not drunk tonight, he knows the show perfectly well. “We are doing Phario’s new Bloody Hand, in <span title="award.n.02:
a tangible symbol signifying approval or distinction" >honor</span> of the envoy from the Seven Kingdoms.”</p><p></p><p>“Now I recall.” Bobono lowered his voice to a sinister <span title="croak.n.01:
a harsh hoarse utterance (as of a frog)" >croak</span>. “The seven-faced god has cheated me,” he said. “My noble <span title="sire.n.01:
a title of address formerly used for a man of rank and authority" >sire</span> he made of <span title="pure.a.01:
free of extraneous elements of any kind" >purest</span> gold, and gold he made my siblings, boy and girl. But I am formed of darker stuff, of bones and blood and clay, twisted into this rude shape you see before you.” With that, he grabbed at her chest, fumbling for a nipple. “You have no <span title="breast.n.02:
either of two soft fleshy milk-secreting glandular organs on the chest of a woman" >titties</span>. How can I rape a girl with no <span title="breast.n.02:
either of two soft fleshy milk-secreting glandular organs on the chest of a woman" >titties</span>?”</p><p></p><p>She caught his nose between her thumb and forefinger and twisted. “You’ll have no nose until you get your hands off me.”</p><p></p><p>“Owwwww,” the dwarf <span title="squeal.v.01:
utter a high-pitched cry, characteristic of pigs" >squealed</span>, releasing her.</p><p></p><p>“I’ll grow <span title="breast.n.02:
either of two soft fleshy milk-secreting glandular organs on the chest of a woman" >titties</span> in a year or two.” Mercy rose, to tower over the little man. “But you’ll never grow another nose. You think of that, before you touch me there.”</p><p></p><p>Bobono rubbed his tender nose. “There’s no need to get so shy. I’ll be raping you soon enough.”</p><p></p><p>“Not until the second act.”</p><p></p><p>“I always give Wendeyne’s <span title="breast.n.02:
either of two soft fleshy milk-secreting glandular organs on the chest of a woman" >titties</span> a nice squeeze when I rape her in The Anguish of the Archon,” the dwarf complained. “She likes it, and the pit does too. You have to please the pit.”</p><p></p><p>That was one of Izembaro’s “wisdoms,” as he liked to call them. You have to please the pit. “I bet it would please the pit if I ripped off the dwarf’s cock and beat him about the head with it,” Mercy replied. “That’s something they won’t have seen before.” Always give them something they haven’t seen before was another of Izembaro’s “wisdoms,” and one that Bobono had no easy answer for. “There, you’re done,” Mercy announced. “Now see if you can keep in your <span title="breeches.n.01:
trousers ending above the knee" >breeches</span> till it’s needed.”</p><p></p><p>Izembaro was calling for her again. Now he could not find his boar spear. Mercy found it for him, helped Big Brusco don his boar suit, checked the trick daggers just to make certain no one had replaced one with a real blade (someone had done that at the Dome once, and a <span title="mime.n.01:
an actor who communicates entirely by gesture and facial expression" >mummer</span> had died), and poured Lady <span title="stork.n.01:
large mostly Old World wading birds typically having white-and-black plumage" >Stork</span> the little <span title="nip.n.01:
a small drink of liquor" >nip</span> of wine she liked to have before each play. When all the cries of “Mercy, Mercy, Mercy” finally died away, she stole a moment for a quick <span title="peek.n.01:
a secret look" >peek</span> out into the house.</p><p></p><p>The pit was as full as ever she’d seen it, and they were enjoying themselves already, joking and <span title="jostle.n.01:
the act of jostling (forcing your way by pushing)" >jostling</span>, eating and drinking. She saw a <span title="peddler.n.01:
someone who travels about selling his wares (as on the streets or at carnivals)" >peddler</span> selling chunks of cheese, ripping them off the wheel with his fingers whenever he found a buyer. A woman had a bag of <span title="purse.v.02:
gather or contract into wrinkles or folds; pucker" >wrinkled</span> apples. Skins of wine were being passed from hand to hand, some girls were selling kisses, and one sailor was playing the sea pipes. The sad-eyed little man called <span title="quill.n.01:
pen made from a bird's feather" >Quill</span> stood in the back, come to see what he could steal for one of his own plays. Cossomo the <span title="magician.n.01:
someone who performs magic tricks to amuse an audience" >Conjurer</span> had come as well, and on his arm was Yna, the one-eyed whore from the Happy Port, but Mercy could not know those two, and they would not know Mercy. Daena recognized some Gate regulars in the crowd, and pointed them out for her; the <span title="dyer.n.01:
someone whose job is to dye cloth" >dyer</span> Dellono with his pinched white face and <span title="mottle.v.01:
mark with spots or blotches of different color or shades of color as if stained" >mottled</span> purple hands, Galeo the sausage-maker in his greasy leather apron, tall Tomarro with his pet rat on his shoulder. “Tomarro best not let Galeo see that rat,” Daena warned. “That’s the only meat he puts in them sausages, I hear.” Mercy covered her mouth and laughed.</p><p></p><p>The balconies were filling too. The first and third levels were for merchants and captains and other respectable folk. The <span title="assassin.n.01:
a murderer (especially one who kills a prominent political figure) who kills by a surprise attack and often is hired to do the deed" >bravos</span> preferred the fourth and highest, where the seats were cheapest. It was a riot of bright <span title="color.n.01:
a visual attribute of things that results from the light they emit or transmit or reflect" >color</span> up there, while down below more <span title="drab.s.02:
lacking brightness or color; dull" >somber</span> shades held sway. The second balcony was cut up into private boxes where the mighty could <span title="behave.v.03:
behave well or properly" >comport</span> themselves in comfort and privacy, safely apart from the vulgarity above and below. They had the best view of the stage, and servants to bring them food, wine, cushions, whatever they might desire. It was rare to find the second balcony more than half full at the Gate; such of the mighty who relished a night of <span title="mummery.n.01:
meaningless ceremonies and flattery" >mummery</span> were more inclined to visit the Dome or the Blue Lantern, where the offerings were considered <span title="elusive.s.03:
difficult to detect or grasp by the mind or analyze" >subtler</span> and more poetic.</p><p></p><p>This night was different, though, no doubt on account of the Westerosi envoy. In one box sat three <span title="scion.n.01:
a descendent or heir" >scions</span> of Otharys, each accompanied by a famous <span title="concubine.n.01:
a woman who cohabits with an important man" >courtesan</span>; Prestayn sat alone, a man so ancient that you wondered how he ever reached his seat; Torone and Pranelis shared a box, as they shared an uncomfortable alliance; the Third Sword was hosting a half-dozen friends.</p><p></p><p>“I count five keyholders,” said Daena.</p><p></p><p>“Bessaro is so fat you ought to count him twice,” Mercy replied, giggling. Izembaro had a belly on him, but compared to Bessaro he was as <span title="lissome.s.01:
moving and bending with ease" >lithe</span> as a willow. The keyholder was so big he needed a special seat, <span title="thrice.r.01:
three times" >thrice</span> the size of a common chair.</p><p></p><p>“They’re all fat, them Reyaans,” Daena said. “Bellies as big as their ships. You should have seen the father. He made this one look small. One time he was summoned to the Hall of Truth to vote, but when he stepped onto his barge it sank.” She clutched Mercy by the elbow. “Look, the Sealord’s box.” The Sealord had never visited the Gate, but Izembaro named a box for him anyway, the largest and most <span title="deluxe.s.01:
rich and superior in quality" >opulent</span> in the house. “That must be the Westerosi envoy. Have you ever seen such clothes on an old man? And look, he’s brought the Black Pearl!”</p><p></p><p>The envoy was slight and balding, with a funny grey <span title="wisp.n.01:
a small tuft or lock" >wisp</span> of a beard growing from his chin. His cloak was yellow velvet, and his <span title="breeches.n.01:
trousers ending above the knee" >breeches</span>. His <span title="doublet.n.01:
a man's close-fitting jacket; worn during the Renaissance" >doublet</span> was a blue so bright it almost made Mercy’s eyes water. Upon his breast a shield had been <span title="embroider.v.01:
decorate with needlework" >embroidered</span> in yellow thread, and on the shield was a proud blue <span title="cock.n.04:
adult male chicken" >rooster</span> picked out in lapis <span title="lapis_lazuli.n.01:
an azure blue semiprecious stone" >lazuli</span>. One of his guards helped him to his seat, while two others stood behind him in the back of the box.</p><p></p><p>The woman with him could not have been more than a third his age. She was so lovely that the lamps seemed to burn brighter when she passed. She had dressed in a low-cut gown of pale yellow silk, startling against the light brown of her skin. Her black hair was bound up in a net of spun gold, and a jet-and-gold necklace brushed against the top of her full breasts. As they watched, she leaned close to the envoy and whispered something in his ear that made him laugh. “They should call her the Brown Pearl,” Mercy said to Daena. “She’s more brown than black.”</p><p></p><p>“The first Black Pearl was black as a pot of ink,” said Daena. “She was a pirate queen, fathered by a Sealord’s son on a princess from the Summer Isles. A dragon king from Westeros took her for his lover.”</p><p></p><p>“I would like to see a dragon,” Mercy said wistfully. “Why does the envoy have a chicken on his chest?”</p><p></p><p>Daena <span title="howl.v.01:
emit long loud cries" >howled</span>. “Mercy, don’t you know anything? It’s his siggle. In the Sunset Kingdoms all the lords have siggles. Some have flowers, some have fish, some have bears and <span title="elk.n.01:
large northern deer with enormous flattened antlers in the male; called `elk' in Europe and `moose' in North America" >elks</span> and other things. See, the envoy’s guards are wearing lions.”</p><p></p><p>It was true. There were four guards; big, hard-looking men in ringmail, with heavy Westerosi longswords <span title="sheathe.v.01:
cover with a protective sheathing" >sheathed</span> at their hips. Their crimson cloaks were bordered in <span title="coil.n.02:
a round shape formed by a series of concentric circles (as formed by leaves or flower petals)" >whorls</span> of gold, and golden lions with red <span title="garnet.n.01:
any of a group of hard glassy minerals (silicates of various metals) used as gemstones and as an abrasive" >garnet</span> eyes clasped each cloak at the shoulder. When Mercy glanced at the faces beneath the <span title="gild.v.01:
